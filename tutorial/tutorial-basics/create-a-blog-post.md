# Create a Blog Post

Docusaurus creates a **page for each blog post**, but also a **blog index page**, a **tag system**, an **RSS** feed...

## Create your first Post

Create a file at `blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md`:

```md title="blog/2021-02-28-greetings.md"
---
slug: greetings
title: Greetings!
authors:
  - name: Joel Marcey
    title: Co-creator of Docusaurus 1
    url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey
    image_url: https://github.com/JoelMarcey.png
  - name: Sébastien Lorber
    title: Docusaurus maintainer
    url: https://sebastienlorber.com

tags: [greetings]

Congratulations, you have made your first post!

Feel free to play around and edit this post as much you like.
```

A new blog post wll now be available.

## Images and folders

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images.

## Authors

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.
