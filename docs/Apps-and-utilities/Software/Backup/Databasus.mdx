# Databasus

Enterprise-Grade Database Backup Management and High-Performance Backup Orchestration.

## Introduction 

Modern database reliability engineering requires more than just scheduled scripts; it demands a robust management layer that handles encryption, multi-destination storage, and team-based access control. **Databasus** (formerly known as *Postgresus*) is a Go-based, open-source backup management system designed to provide a secure, self-hosted control plane for PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and MongoDB.

By focusing on security-first features like AES-256-GCM encryption and zero-trust storage, it addresses the critical need for protecting database snapshots in shared or public cloud environments while maintaining a high-performance, developer-centric experience.

## Tool Overview

*Source: [databasus/databasus (GitHub)](https://github.com/databasus/databasus)*

Databasus serves as a comprehensive lifecycle manager for database snapshots, moving from simple UI wrappers to a full management ecosystem.

### Core Functionalities

* **Multi-Engine Support:** Native support for PostgreSQL (12-18), MySQL (5.7-9), MariaDB (10-11), and MongoDB (4-8).
* **Enterprise Security:** Implements **AES-256-GCM encryption** for backup files, ensuring that even if storage (like S3 or Google Drive) is compromised, the data remains unreadable.
* **Granular Scheduling & Compression:** Supports precise cron-based timing and intelligent compression algorithms capable of 4-8x space savings with minimal CPU overhead.
* **Workspace & RBAC:** Includes team management features such as Workspaces to group databases and Role-Based Access Control (Viewer, Member, Admin, Owner).
* **Notification Ecosystem:** Real-time alerting via Telegram, Slack, Discord, Email, and Webhooks for backup success or failure.
* **Extensive Storage Support:** Native integration with Local storage, S3 (AWS, R2, MinIO), Google Drive, Dropbox, SFTP, and FTP.

## Technical Critique: Operational Implementation

### 1. Learning Curves & Deployment

* **Modern Deployment Stack:** Optimized for containerized environments with official support for Docker, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes (via Helm). The automated installation script simplifies the "Day 0" setup on Linux systems.
* **Identity Management:** While the UI is intuitive, teams must manage the transition from single-user setups to Workspace-based environments, which requires planning around team permissions and audit logging.

### 2. Hardware and Performance Dependencies

* **Go-Based Efficiency:** Written in Go, the backend is highly performant and lightweight compared to Python or Node-based alternatives. It is well-suited for high-concurrency environments where multiple backups may trigger simultaneously.
* **CPU-Bound Encryption:** The use of AES-256-GCM is secure but compute-intensive during the backup phase. On hardware without AES-NI instructions (older CPUs or small ARM instances), backup windows may extend significantly.
* **Storage Latency:** Since Databasus supports remote mounts like Google Drive and SFTP, the "Backup Window" is often bottlenecked by upstream network bandwidth rather than the database engine itself.

### 3. Operational Risks

* **Credential Handling:** Databasus utilizes a read-only user approach by default to minimize risk. However, the system still manages credentials for multiple production databases; network isolation (VPN/VPC) for the Databasus UI is mandatory.
* **Tooling Transition:** As the project recently migrated from *Postgresus* to *Databasus*, users on legacy versions must follow specific migration paths to ensure data folder and internal database naming compatibility.
* **Encryption Key Management:** Since backups are encrypted before upload, the loss of the encryption key results in a total loss of all off-site backups. A robust backup strategy for the Databasus internal configuration itself is critical.
