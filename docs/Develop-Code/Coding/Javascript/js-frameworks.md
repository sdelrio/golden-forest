# Javascript Frameworks


## Common Frameworks

* **React**: The most popular library for building user interfaces, maintained by Meta. Huge ecosystem and community.
* **Vue.js**: A progressive framework that is approachable and versatile.
* **Angular**: A platform for building mobile and desktop web applications, maintained by Google.

## NextJS

Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

## Svelte

Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.

* **No Virtual DOM**: Svelte compiles your code to tiny, framework-less vanilla JS -> faster apps.
* **Truly Reactive**: No complex state management libraries needed for simple things.

## High Performance & Fastest

* **SolidJS**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a compiled approach similar to Svelte but with React-like syntax.
* **Astro**: A web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs, portfolios, and e-commerce. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default.
* **Qwik**: A framework that allows for instant loading of web applications, regardless of the size of the application or complexity.
* **Fastify**: (Backend) An efficient and low overhead web framework for Node.js.

## Compile-time Optimizations

Tools and modes that shift work from runtime to build time, inspired by Svelte's approach.

* **React Compiler (React Forget)**: An automatic memoizing compiler for React that optimizes your app by memoizing values and components at build time.
* **Million.js**: An optimizing compiler for React that uses a block virtual DOM to make components up to 70% faster.
* **Vue Vapor Mode**: An opt-in performance mode for Vue that compiles templates to direct DOM manipulation code, bypassing the Virtual DOM.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that provides a robust development experience through four key components:

* **Language**: Extends JavaScript syntax with type annotations.
* **Type Checker**: Performs static analysis to ensure type safety and catch errors during development.
* **Compiler**: Transforms TypeScript code into standard, executable JavaScript.
* **Language Services**: Powers IDE features like IntelliSense, autocompletion, and automated refactoring.
