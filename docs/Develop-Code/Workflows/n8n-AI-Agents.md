# n8n: AI Agent Workflows 🤖

n8n is an incredibly powerful, free, and open-source platform that allows for the creation
of complex workflows and data pipelines with minimal code. It stands out in the automation
space by adopting a "fair-code" license model and offering a highly flexible, node-based
visual editor.

While traditionally known for integrating SaaS applications (CRM, databases, messaging),
n8n has rapidly evolved into a critical tool for modern software architecture,
specifically for designing and deploying **Production-Grade AI Agents**.

This section explores how to leverage n8n's visual workflow capabilities, its native
ntegrations, and its extensibility (via custom JavaScript functions) to:

1. **Orchestrate LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Chain multiple models, manage contextual
memory, and handle complex prompt engineering.

2. **Tool Use & Grounding**: Equip AI agents with tools to interact with external systems
(APIs, databases, RAG pipelines).

3. **Reliable Deployment**: Design workflows robust enough for production environments,
focusing on error handling, logging, and scaling strategies.

These notes aim to guide the transition from simple automated flows to fully functional,
decision-making AI agents.
