# 45 Prompts for Gemini 3

This guide gathers 45 foolproof prompts to make the most of **Gemini 3**, Google's most powerful AI, which landed in November 2025. We have tracked the most reliable sources on the internet to compile these prompts and organized them into three specialized sections, each containing 15 high-impact prompts, so you can find exactly what you need instantly.

## What makes Gemini 3 special?

It stands out for its extraordinary reasoning, total multimodal understanding (mastering text, images, video, and audio), and an incredible capacity for autonomous programming (agentic coding). Additionally, it plays in a different league thanks to its massive memory: a context window of between 1 and 2 million tokens, depending on whether you use the Pro or Flash version.
