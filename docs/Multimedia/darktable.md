### DisplayCall

Display calibration and profiling with a focus on accuracy and versatility

*    Requires to install python2 on new distributions like Ubuntu 20
*    Lot slower than official software (it could last 15+ mins to callibrate)
*    It support calibrators like Spyder 2 Pro, that actually doesn't have drivers for windows 10, so it could be easy to find on eBay cheap
*    Ubuntu 20, Linux Mint 20, and other clones already comes with ArgyllCMS on their gnome desktops
