# Selenium

Selenium is a automation testing tool's framework. It's based on the JavaScript.

Automated Selenium testing is commonly used by QAs for replicating end-user actions on websites to monitor their behaviour. It drives the interactions that occur on the target web page and could run them automatically, without requiring manual inputs.

Selenium suite has 4 components:

* Selenium Grid
* Selenium IDE
* Selenium RC
* Selenium Webdriver

## Selenium Grid

Selenium Grid is a tool used for concurrent execution of test cases on different browsers, machines, and operating systems simultaneously. This tool makes Cross-browser compatibility testing very easy.

There are two versions of the Selenium Grid

* Grid 1: The older version.
* Grid 2: The recent version.

## Selenium IDE

Selenium IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is primarily a record/run tool. It is an Add-on or an extension available for both Firefox and Chrome that generates tests quickly through its functionality of record and playback. You donâ€™t need to learn any test scripting language for authoring any functional tests.

## Selenium RC

Selenium RC is a testing framework that enables a QA or a developer to write test cases in any programming language in order to automate UI tests for web applications against any HTTP website.

Selenium RC has of two parts:

*  Client libraries: For the preferred computer language.
*  A server: It launches and kills browsers automatically.

## Selenium WebDriver 

Is an enhanced version of Selenium RC. It was introduced in the market to overcome the limitation faced in Selenium RC. Though it is an advanced version of RC, its architecture is completely different from that of RC. Just like Selenium RC, Selenium WebDriver too supports multiple programming platforms to provide wider flexibility and requires knowing any one programming language.
