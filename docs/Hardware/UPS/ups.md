# UPS

Uninterruptible Power Source (UPS) is an electrical apparatus that provides emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails. 
An UPS differs from an auxiliary or emergency power system or standby generator in that it will provide near-instantaneous protection from input power 
interruptions, by supplying energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. 

The on-battery run-time of most uninterruptible power sources is relatively short (only a few minutes) but sufficient to start a standby power source 
or properly shut down the protected equipment.
