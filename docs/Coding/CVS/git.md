# GIT

GIT is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complet history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

## Delete remote tag

```bash
git push --delete origin tagName
git tag -d tagName
```

## Git Large File Storage

Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise.

* [An open source it extension for versioning large files](https://git-lfs.github.com/)

### Setup
```bash
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.psd"
git add .gitattributes
```

### Add large file sample

```bash
git add file.psd
git commit -m "Add design file"
git push origin main
```

## Git terminal colors

* `~/.gitconfig`

```ini
[color]
    diff = always
    ui = always
    status = auto
    branch = auto
    interactive = auto
    pager = true
[color "status"]
  added = green
  changed = red bold
  untracked = magenta bold

[color "branch"]
  remote = yellow
```


## Alias

* `~/.gitconfig`

```ini
[alias]
    review = "!f() { git push -u ${1:-origin} HEAD:`git config branch.$(git name-rev --name-only HEAD).merge | sed -e 's@refs/heads/@refs/for/@'`; }; f"
    unstage = reset --soft HEAD^
	ls = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate
	ll = log --pretty=format:"%C(yellow)%h%Cred%d\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\ [%cn]" --decorate --numstat
    st = status -s
    gl = clone
    ci = commit
    co = checkout
    br = branch
    dif = diff --word-diff
    diff1 = diff HEAD^
    diff2 = diff HEAD^^
    dc = diff --cached
    r = reset
    r1 = reset HEAD^
    r2 = reset HEAD^^
    rh = reset --hard
    rh1 = reset HEAD^ --hard
    rh2 = reset HEAD^^ --hard
```

## Remove directory from cache 

Remove directory from remote repository after adding them to `.gitignore`

```bash
git rm -r --cached node_modules
git commit -m 'Remove the now ignored directory node_modules'
git push origin master
```
