# Gerrit

Gerrit is a free, web-based team code collaboration tool. Software developers in a team can review each other's modifications on their source code using a Web browser and approve or reject those changes. It integrates closely with Git, a distributed version control system.

Gerrit is a fork of Rietveld, another code review tool. Both are namesakes of Dutch designer Gerrit Rietveld.
