# Python Code Formater

## Black

### Installation

Black can be installed by running `pip install black`. It requires Python 3.6.2+ to run. If you want to format Jupyter Notebooks, install with `pip install black[jupyter]`.

### Usage

To get started right away with sensible defaults:

```bash
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

You can run Black as a package if running it as a script doesn't work:

```bash
python -m black {source_file_or_directory}
```
