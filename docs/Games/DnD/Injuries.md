# Lingering Injuries

Lingering injuries represent physical trauma that extends beyond immediate recovery. In real-world medical terms, these are chronic or severe acute conditions—such as compound fractures, deep tissue scarring, or neurological damage—that require specialized treatment and extended periods of rehabilitation. Unlike transient injuries, they often impose long-term functional limitations on the individual.

A character sustains a lingering injury under the following conditions:

+ Being reduced to 0 hit points.
+ Taking damage equal to or greater than (8 + Constitution modifier) while at 0 hit points.
+ Triggering a moderate, severe, or deadly trap.
+ A critical hit or fumble result specifies an injury.

## Injury Treatment

### Medical Treatment (Medicine)

+ Medical treatment requires the expenditure of Healer's Kit uses for every medicine check attempted.
+ Light injuries can be treated as an action during combat. All other injuries can only be treated during a short or long rest. Only one check per injury can be attempt on each rest.
+ Injuries marked with the Ø symbol cannot be treated without magical healing.
+ A character proficient in medicine can spend 1 use of the Healer's Kit to automatically stabilize a dying character. If not proficient, the character rolls a WIS check vs DC 10 (or DC 15 if an enemy is within 5 feet of you or your target).
+ A Healer's kit can also be used to restore 1d4 hp to a stabilized character with 0 hit points. It requires medicine check DC 15 (DC 10 when out of combat)

### Magical Treatment (Potions and Healing Spells)

:::note
To Heal lingering injuries the target must be ___Stable___ first.

+ Magical treatment includes spells, potions and ointments that can be used for healing.
+ Healing spells that don't target a character like aura of vitality don't clear injuries. Injury healing require spells that don't have an area effect. Those spells provide a general condition improvement, but are too vague to heal more permanent damage.
+ Lesser Restoration can be used to treat Severe Wounds by casting it multiple times. Every casting counts as a medicine success for this purpose but cannot be used to treat Severe Wounds with the Ø symbol.
+ Greater Restoration ca be used to treat Critical Wounds by casting it multiple times. Every casting counts as a medicine success for this purpose.
