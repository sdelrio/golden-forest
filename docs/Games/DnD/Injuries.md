## Injury Treatment

### Medical Treatment (Medicine)

+ Medical treatment requires the expenditure of Healer's Kit uses for every medicine check attempted.
+ Light injuries can be treated as an action during combat. All other injuries can only be treated during a short or long rest. Only one check per injury can be attempt on each rest.
+ Injuries marked with the Ø symbol cannot be treated without magical healing.
+ A character proficient in medicine can spend 1 use of the Healer's Kit to automatically stabilize a dying character. If not proficient, the character rolls a WIS check vs DC 10 (or DC 15 if an enemy is within 5 feet of you or your target).
+ A Healier's kit can also be used to restore 1d4 hp to a stabilized character with 0 hit points. It requires medicine check DC 15 (DC 10 when out of combat)

### Magical Treatment (Potions and Healing Spells)

:::note
To Heal lingering injuries the target must be ___Stable___ first.

+ Magical treatment includes spells, potions and ointments that can be used for healing.
+ Healing spells that don't target a character like aura of vitality don't clear injuries. Injury healing require spells that don't have an area effect. Those spells provide a general condition improvement, but are too vague to heal more permanent damage.
+ Lesser Restoration can be used to treat Severe Wounds by casting it multiple times. Every casting counts as a medicine success for this purpose but cannot be used to treat Severe Wounds with the Ø symbol.
+ Greater Restoration ca be used to treat Critical Wounds by casting it multiple times. Every casting counts as a medicine success for this purpose.
