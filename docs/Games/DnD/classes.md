## Paladin  

### Level 1 - Laying on hands  
Must be used in 5 hit point chunks. There's no limit on the number of 5-point chunks the character can use per healing.


### Level 2 - Paladin's Smite  
You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.  

### Level 5 - Weapon of Honor (Replaces Faithful Steed)  
You can choose a melee weapon type to be your weapon of honor.  
In addition to the regular mastery associated with your weapon of honor, you can forfeit the mastery in another weapon to give your weapon of honor a second mastery of your choice.
