Must be used in 5 hit point chunks. There's no limit on the number of 5-point chunks the character can use per healing.

### Level 2 - Paladin's Smite

You always have the Divine Smite spell prepared. In addition, you can cast it without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again.

### Level 5 - Weapon of Honor (Replaces Faithful Steed)

You can choose a melee weapon type to be your weapon of honor.
In addition to the regular mastery associated with your weapon of honor, you can forfeit the mastery in another weapon to give your weapon of honor a second mastery of your choice.

## Cleric

### Level 1 - Divine Order

#### Thaumaturge

You can prepare one additional spell from any **Divine Magic** class including those available only to certain subclasses. You always have the spell prepared and it must be a spell of a level you are able to cast. You can change that spell for another elegible spell when you level up. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

#### Protector

You can learn the **True Strike** cantrip.
