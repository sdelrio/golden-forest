## Rolling skill checks without proficiency 

There are some skills which require knowledge or practice which is very specialized (somebody without previous training cannot seriously play a violin or know arcane lore without having studied it before).  
The following skils fall into this category, and cannot be rolled without proficiency:  
- **Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, Play Instrument and almost all tools**.  
- **Thieves' Tools** can be used with **Sleight of Hand** without adding the proficiency bonus.


## Attunement

You can attune to an item during a short or long rest.  
Attuning to a item requires a number of successful checks depending on item rarity, as indicated the table below. 
:::note
The DC of this check is 15.  
:::
The number of successes must be consecutive, and the check is made using : `Arcana check OR your Spellcasting ability + Prof bonus`.  
If the roll is a failure you can commit all your energies to try to master the item. If you do, you roll until you get the required number of successes. Then count the number of failures and for each one of them, roll a CON SAVE against the item CON SAVE DC indicated in the table. For each CON Save failure, you gain one level of exhaustion. If you go above 5 levels of exhaustion roll a WIS saving throw against the CON SAVE DC of the item, if you succeed, you break from the influence of the item before it's too late (death by exhaustion).  
Any exhaustion levels from attunement are removed by a single cast of Greater Restoration or by successfully finishing a long rest (if you have other sources of exhaustion, it cannot be reduced until this exhaustion is removed first).  


| Item Rarity | Successes required | CON SAVE DC |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Common | Automatic | - |
| Uncommon | 2 | 10 |
| Rare | 3 | 12 |
| Very Rare | 4 | 15 |
| Legendary | 4 | 18 |
| Artifact | 5 | 20 |


## Crafting

***PHB 233***

:::note Crafting Time
Crafting non-magical items takes a number of workdays (8h/day) equal to: `The purchase price of the item / 10`
Another character can combine its efforts halving the crafting time and but It must be proficient with the required tools.
:::


:::note Raw Materials
To make an item, you need raw materials worth half the purchase cost of the item (rounded down). The DM determines wheter the appropiate raw materials are available.
:::

Failing the crafting roll that extra time and resources are needed. Determine the margin of failure and check the table below:

| Margin of Failure | Result | 
|:-----------:|:--------------:
| 1 | Add +10% cost in raw materials |
| 2 | Add +10% cost in raw materials and take 50% extra time or an extra day, whichever is lower |
| 3-4 | Add +25% cost in raw materials and take 50% extra time or 2 extra days, whichever is lower |
| 5 | Add +25% cost in raw materials and take 50% extra time or 1 extra day, whichever is higher |
| 6+ or natural 1 | Total failure. Materials and work are hopelessly wasted |

#### Alchemical Potions

Alchemical potions contain spells, mimic the effects of spells or have an effect out of the scope of normal spells, such as a Potion of Giant Strength. 
Brewing this kind of potions is a process full of danger and ingenuity. The act of creating these magic items is called alchemy, and those who hone this craft are often alchemist artificers, wizards, or similarly intelligent specialists with an affinity for chemistry.  

Magic is not a cooperative energy and doesn’t appreciate being forced into a tiny bottle for consumption. Despite the best efforts of countless crafters, the process of brewing potions has never been successfully automated, with any attempt leading to catastrophic results. Brewers must slave over their work, watching for a sign of things about to go terribly wrong. The difficulty and time required to complete this process is determined by the potion’s rarity.

`A series of successful Intelligence ability checks (typically three) is required to complete this process, along with an extended waiting period while the potion brews.`  

The nature of the ability checks represents the 3 steps necessary to complete the process: The creation of the Potion’s base, the addition of the bonding agent and the infusion of magic into the potion.
At minimum this requires a set of alchemist’s supplies, but many experienced crafters use something far more elaborate and safer laboratories, with specialized equipment to make this checks easier.

:::warning
Additionally, when a creature attempting to brew a potion fails an Intelligence ability check by 10 or more, the potion explodes catastrophically, destroying any tools or equipment that were being used to create it.
:::

Finally, an alchemist crafting a potion must acquire specific and potent ingredients. These components are used in various stages of the brewing process, forming the potion’s base and bonding agent, the details of which follow. Note that these do not encompass all the ingredients required to create a potion, merely the most significant ones.
'The difficulty DC and time required to brew a potion according to its rarity are detailed in the Alchemy Crafting table.'


**ALCHEMICAL CRAFTING TABLE**

| Rarity | Ability Check DC | Brewing Time (1) | Reagent rarity by CR | Potion Spell Level |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Common | 12 | 0.5 | < CR 1 | Cantrip |
| Uncommon | 14 | 1 | CR 1-3 | 1st-2nd |
| Rare | 17 | 7 | CR 4-9 | 3rd-4th |
| Very Rare | 20 | 14 | CR 10-16 | 5th-6th |
| Legendary | 25 | 30 | CR 17-22 | 7th-8th |
| Epic | 30 | 90 | CR 23+ | 9th-Epic 1st |
| Mythic | 35 | 180 | Mythic | Epic 2nd-Epic 3rd |

(1) Elixirs require double this time

At the end of each of these steps, the 

##### STEP 1 - ALCHEMICAL BASE (Alchemist's Supplies or Brewer Supplies)

Making a potion with ordinary water is a literal recipe for disaster.
Mystical fluids with strange properties are far more effective. Rarer potions require bases that are incredibly dangerous, expensive, or both.
The blood of a troll, a compound synthesized through transmutation magic, or the rain from a magic-soaked world are all examples of appropriate bases for brewing potions.
When crafting potions, the first Intelligence ability check performed should be themed around preparing or synthesizing this alchemical base.
`At the end of this process roll and Alchemist's supplies or Brewer's supplies tool check`

##### STEP 2 - BONDING REAGENT (Alchemist's Supplies)

Binding magic to an alchemical base requires a potent agent through which the magic will flow.
These bonding agents are often harvested from magical creatures and are consumed in the process of brewing the potion. The school of magic that best fits the potion’s magical effect determines what kind of creature a bonding agent must be harvested from, as detailed in the Bonding Agent Harvesting table.
Additionally, the rarity of the potion determines of strength of the creature from which the bonding agent must be harvested.

**BONDING AGENT HARVESTING**

| Magical Effect Affinity | Creature Type|
|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| Abjuration | Construct, Plant, Celestial |
| Conjuration | Elemental, Fiend, Celestial |
| Divination | Celestial, Beast, Plant |
| Enchantment | Fiend, Fey, Aberration |
| Evocation | Dragon, Elemental, Ooze |
| Illusion | Fey, Elemental, Aberration |
| Necromancy | Undead, Fiend, Ooze |
| Transmutation | Ooze, Aberration, Monstrosity |

`At the end of this process roll and Alchemist's supplies tool check´

##### STEP 3 - MAGIC INFUSION

The last step of alchemy is infusing magic to the base + reagent. The alchemist must cast a spell of the same level as the potion spell level and it must be from the school of magic the reagent has affinity for.
`At the end of this process roll and Alchemist's supplies tool check or Arcana skill check`
