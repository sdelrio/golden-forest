## Rolling skill checks without proficiency 
There are some skills which require knowledge or practice which is very specialized (somebody without previous training cannot seriously play a violin or know arcane lore without having studied it before).  
The following skils fall into this category, and cannot be rolled without proficiency: **Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, Play Instrument and almost all tools**.  
**Thieves' Tools** can be used with **Sleight of Hand** without adding the proficiency bonus.
