## Rolling skill checks without proficiency 

There are some skills which require knowledge or practice which is very specialized (somebody without previous training cannot seriously play a violin or know arcane lore without having studied it before).  
The following skils fall into this category, and cannot be rolled without proficiency:  
- **Arcana, History, Medicine, Nature, Performance, Religion, Play Instrument and almost all tools**.  
- **Thieves' Tools** can be used with **Sleight of Hand** without adding the proficiency bonus.


## Attunement

You can attune to an item during a short or long rest.  
Attuning to a item requires a number of successful checks depending on item rarity, as indicated the table below. 
:::note
The DC of this check is 15.  
:::
The number of successes must be consecutive, and the check is made using : `Arcana check OR your Spellcasting ability + Prof bonus`.  
If the roll is a failure you can commit all your energies to try to master the item. If you do, you roll until you get the required number of successes. Then count the number of failures and for each one of them, roll a CON SAVE against the item CON SAVE DC indicated in the table. For each CON Save failure, you gain one level of exhaustion. If you go above 5 levels of exhaustion roll a WIS saving throw against the CON SAVE DC of the item, if you succeed, you break from the influence of the item before it's too late (death by exhaustion).  
Any exhaustion levels from attunement are removed by a single cast of Greater Restoration or by successfully finishing a long rest (if you have other sources of exhaustion, it cannot be reduced until this exhaustion is removed first).  


| Item Rarity | Successes required | CON SAVE DC |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Common | Automatic | - |
| Uncommon | 2 | 10 |
| Rare | 3 | 12 |
| Very Rare | 4 | 15 |
| Legendary | 4 | 18 |
| Artifact | 5 | 20 |


## Crafting

***PHB 233***

:::note Crafting Time
Crafting non-magical items takes a number of workdays (8h/day) equal to: `The purchase price of the item / 10`
Another character can combine its efforts halving the crafting time and but It must be proficient with the required tools.
:::


:::note Raw Materials
To make an item, you need raw materials worth half the purchase cost of the item (rounded down). The DM determines wheter the appropiate raw materials are available.
