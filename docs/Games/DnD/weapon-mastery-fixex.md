## Weapon masteries

### Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature and its not an automatic miss, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. 
This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.  

### Cleave

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within ypur reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

### Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have Advantage on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn. 

### Brutal Crit

Critical range increasee by 1 **AND** you add an extra critical damage die.  

### Parry

As a reaction after being hit by a melee attack, you can add +2 to your AC, potentially causing the attack to miss.

### Fast Reload

When you take the attack action using a reload weapon, you can reload the weapon as a bonus action and make a second attack as part of the attack action if you are able (e.g. extra attack feature, haste, etc.)

### Extended Range

You ignore disadvantage when attacking beyond normal range and you reroll the 1's in the damage rolls.

### Powerful

This mastery is exclusively for firearms.  
Critical range increased by 1 and when the weapon damage dice show a 10 or better result, you can add another damage dice to the damage roll and keep rolling until this condition is not true.

## Changing Weapon Masteries  

A character can change its weapon masteries when it gains a level.
