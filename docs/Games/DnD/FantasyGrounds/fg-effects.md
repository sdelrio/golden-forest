In the **Better Combat Effects (BCE) Gold** extension for Fantasy Grounds, you can use the `EXPIREADD`, `RESTS` and `TREGENA` conditional operators to create a *"looping"* effect that re-applies itself and triggers a *"pulse"* of temporary hit points every time a rest occurs. Conditional Operators are Not case-sensitive.

### Important Tips

- **Spelling Matters**: Ensure the name in `EXPIREADD` matches the name of the other effect in your Custom Effects list **exactly**.

- **Non-Stacking**: Note that `TREGENA` follows standard 5e rules; it will not add 5 to existing Temp HP. It will set them to 5 (or keep them higher if the character already had more than 5).

- **Visibility**: If you don't want the effect text to clutter the tracker, you can set the  effect to *"GM Only"* or *"Hidden"* in the Custom Effects settings.

## Larger Than Life Feat

To set up **Larger Than Life** (LTL), you will need to create two separate entries in your **Custom Effects** list (the star icon in the upper right of the desktop) and then apply the first one to the character.

### Step 1: Create the Custom Effects

Open your **Custom Effects** window and add these two exact lines:

|Effect Name|Effect String|
|---|---|
|**LTL_Tracker**|`LTL_Tracker; EXPIREADD: LTL_Heal; RESTS`|
|**LTL_Heal**|`LTL_Heal; TREGENA: 5; EXPIREADD: LTL_Tracker`|

:::note Effect Naming
The "Effect Name" (how it appears in the Combat Tracker) is defined by the **first segment** of the string (the text before the first `;`). For example, in the first line above, the effect name is `LTL_Tracker`. And is case-sensitive.
:::

### Step 2: Application

Once you have defined these in your Custom Effects:

1. Drag **LTL_Tracker** onto the character in the Combat Tracker.

2. Leave it there permanently.

3. Whenever the DM clicks *"Short Rest"* or *"Long Rest"* in the Combat Tracker menu, the character will see a message in the chat and their Temp HP will update to 5.

### How it Works

1. **LTL_Tracker**: This sits on the character's Combat Tracker entry. The `RESTS` tag tells Fantasy Grounds to expire this effect immediately when a Short or Long rest is taken.

2. **EXPIREADD: LTL_Heal**: When the tracker expires (due to the rest), it automatically "fires" the second effect, `LTL_Heal`.

3. **TREGENA: 5**: It stands for **T**emp **REGEN** **A**dd (instant). It immediately grants 5 temporary hit points to the character the moment the effect is added.

4. **EXPIREADD: LTL_Tracker**: Since `LTL_Heal` doesn't have a duration, it applies its 5 THP and then immediately expires, which triggers the original `LTL_Tracker` to be put back on the character, resetting the loop for the next rest.

## Attack & Damage Differentiation

* Spell Attack Bonus: `ATK: 10, spell` (Adds 10 only to spell attacks)

* Weapon Attack Bonus: `ATK: 2, weapon, melee` (Adds 2 only to melee weapon attacks)

* Spell Resistance: `RESIST: all, spell` (Resists all damage coming from spell-type attacks)

## Ongoing Saves & Effects

* Save at Start of Turn: `SAVEST: wisdom; SaveDamage: 1d6 poison; SaveAd: Poisoned` (Rolls a Wisdom save at the start of the turn; on failure, takes damage and adds the "Poisoned" condition)

* Tick-Tock (Chained Effects): `Tick; ExpireAdd: Talk` (When "Tick" expires, it automatically adds the "Talk" effect)

## Macros (Automatic Scaling)

* Spell Save DC (SDC): `SAVE: [SAVEDC] wisdom` (Automatically replaces [SDC] with the actor's actual Spell Save DC). (Don't use `SDC`, is deprecated)

* Attribute Scaling: `STR: [19-STR]` (Used for items like Gauntlets of Ogre Power to set Strength to 19 regardless of the base score)

* Proficiency: `ATK: [PRF]` (Adds the actor's proficiency bonus to the attack)

## Conditional Operators (If/Then Logic)

* Target Type: `IFT: TYPE(humanoid); ATK: 2` (Grants +2 to attack if the target is a humanoid)

* Inverse Logic: `IF: !CUSTOM(Sneak Attack); ATK: 10` (Adds 10 to the attack if the actor does not have the "Sneak Attack" effect)

* Pack Tactics Logic: `IF: RANGE(5); IFT: ADJ(enemy); ADVATK` (Grants advantage if within 5ft and an enemy is adjacent to the target)

## Special Utility Tags

* Destroy: `IFT: CR(<=.25); Destroy` (Instantly sets HP to 0 and burns death saves if the target's CR is 0.25 or lower; useful for "Destroy Undead")

* Sneak Attack: `Sneak Attack` (Simply adding this tag automates the once-per-turn damage and removal based on weapon type). It's defined in the `BCE - Core` extension.

* Immune to Effect: `Immune: CUSTOM(Frightened)` (Makes the actor immune to a specific custom-labeled effect)
