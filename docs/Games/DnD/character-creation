# Character Creation

## Stat Rolling
Stats are rolled after the choice of Cass, Species and Background is made.  
Stats are rolled in order, and after that, the player can swap one Ability Score for another one.  
**Mulligan**: The player can scrap its Stat Rolls and choose to use Mulligan set instead: 15-14-12-12-10-8
