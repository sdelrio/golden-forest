# Character Creation

## Stat Rolling
Stats are rolled after the choice of Cass, Species and Background is made.  
Stats are rolled in order, rolling 4d6 and keeping the 3 highest (/die 4d6k3). After that, the player can also swap one Ability Score for another one.  
**Mulligan**: The player can scrap its Stat Rolls and choose to use the Mulligan set instead: 15-14-12-12-10-8
