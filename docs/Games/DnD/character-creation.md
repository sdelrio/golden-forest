# Character Creation

1. Choice Class
2. Choose Origin (Backgrounds)
3. Choose Species
4. Choose Languages. A character knows at least 3 languages: Common, Its racial language, plus another standard language.
5. Stats Rolling or standard set with point distribution (`15-14-13-12-10-8`).

## Stat Rolling

Stats are rolled in order, rolling for each stat 4d6 dice and keeping the 3 highest.

:::tip Fantasy Grounds
Can use the command: `/die 4d6k3` 
:::

After that, the player can also swap one Ability Score for another one.  

### Mulligan

The player can scrap its Stat Rolls and choose to use the Mulligan set instead: `15-14-12-12-10-8`.


### Hit points rolling

When leveling up, instead of taking the average value, a character rolls its hit point increase.  

The character roll its hit die and makes the following adjustment:  

#### Classes rolling d6's or d8's 

If the result is odd, round up to the next even number.

:::note
E.g. If the player rolls a 3 on a d6, it's rounded up to 4. If it rolls a 2, the result is unchanged.  
:::

#### Classes rolling d10's or d12's 

Add +1 to the roll. The modified total cannot be higher than the highest value of the dice.

:::note
E.g. If the player rolls a d10 and the result is 6, it becomes a 7. If it instead rolls a 10 on the d10, it stays a 10 (not an 11).
