# Character Creation

## Stat Rolling
Stats are rolled after the choice of Cass, Species and Background is made.  
Stats are rolled in order, rolling 4d6 and keeping the 3 highest (/die 4d6k3). After that, the player can also swap one Ability Score for another one.  
**Mulligan**: The player can scrap its Stat Rolls and choose to use the Mulligan set instead: 15-14-12-12-10-8  

## Hit points rolling
When levelling up, instead of taking the average value, a character rolls its hit point increase.  
The character roll its hit die and makes the following adjustment:  
- **Classes that roll d6's or d8's**: If the result is odd, round up to the next even number. E.g. If the player rolls a 3, it's rounded up to 4. If it rolls a 2, the result is unchanged.  
- **Classes that roll d10's or d12's**: Add +1 to the roll. The modified total cannot be higher than the highest value of the dice. E.g. If the player rolls a d10 and the result is 6, it becomes a 7. If instead rolls a 10 on the d10, it stays a 10 (not an 11).
