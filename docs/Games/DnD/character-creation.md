# Character Creation

Follow these steps to create your character:

1. **Select a Class**: Determine your character's primary role and core abilities.
2. **Choose an Origin**: Select a background to define your character's history and starting proficiencies.
3. **Select a Species**: Choose your character's biological heritage.
4. **Determine Languages**: Each character knows at least three languages: Common, a species-specific language, and one additional standard language of your choice.
5. **Generate Ability Scores**: Determine your stats using the Point Buy system, the standard array, or by rolling.

## Standard Array

The standard array for ability scores is: `15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8`.

## Point Buy System

Use the interactive calculator below to allocate your ability scores using the standard D&D 5e point-buy system:

## Stat Rolling

Stats are rolled in order, rolling for each stat 4d6 dice and keeping the 3 highest.

:::tip Fantasy Grounds
Can use the command: `/die 4d6k3` 
:::

After that, the player can also swap one Ability Score for another one.  

### Mulligan

Players may discard their rolled ability scores and use the Mulligan array instead: `15, 14, 12, 12, 10, 8`.

## Hit points rolling

When leveling up, instead of taking the average value, a character rolls its hit point increase.  

The character roll its hit die and makes the following adjustment:  

#### Classes rolling d6's or d8's 

If the result is odd, round up to the next even number.

:::note[Example]
A roll of 3 on a d6 is rounded up to 4. A roll of 2 remains unchanged.
:::

#### Classes rolling d10's or d12's 

Add +1 to the roll. The modified total cannot be higher than the highest value of the dice.

:::note[Example]
E.g. If the player rolls a 6 on a d10, it's increased to 7. If it rolls a 10, the result is unchanged.
