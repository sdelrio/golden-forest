### Automatic Miss  

Feature effects that produce an effect on a miss,like *Potent Cantrips*, don't work on automatic misses  

### Safe Spells  

There's no 100% safe mechanism to make allies immune to area spells. Evoker's `Sculpt spell` and Sorcerer's `Careful spell` grant allies the `Evasion` feature  

:::note
**Evasion:** When you're subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw and only half damage if you fail. If incapacitated, this evasion still works, the ally rolls the save as if not incapacitated

## Spells

### True Strike

This spell damage is the same as the weapon damage type. If the weapon is magical, the damage is magical.


### Ray of enfeeblement

This spell doesn't require concentration  

### Shield of faith

This spell doesn't require concentration but its duration is decreased to 1 minute

## Resurrection Effects

### Revivify

Every time a character cast Revivify, its life force is diminished. The caster permanently loses 1 point from a random ability score.  

### Three strikes and you are out

If the character is being brought from the dead for a 3rd time, instead of being raised, the character receiving the resurrection must roll Death Saving Throws.  
If successful, he's resurrected. If not, the spell is wasted.  
The more powerful resurrection spells can bring the character to life more easily:  
- *Revivify and Raise Dead*: No bonus  
- *Resurrection and Reincarnation*: Advantage on the character's Death Saving Throws.  
- *True Resurrection and Wish*: Automatic Success.  
  
### Resurrection weakness

If a Character dies again while still weak from the negative effects of a resurrection spell, it loses 1 point of Constitution permanently.  

## Spellcasting Services  
The pricing for spellcasting services listed in page 232 PHB is outrageous.  
Instead, the pricing in gold pieces for these services is calculated using the following formula:  

$$
(\text{Spell Level}^2 * 25) + (\text{Consumed Material Component Cost} + (0.10 * \text{Non-consumed Material Component Cost})
$$

:::note

Spells cast as rituals cost half the price of the service (component cost remain the same as above)
