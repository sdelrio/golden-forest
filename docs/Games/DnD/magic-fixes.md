# Magic fixes

## General Magic Rules

### Automatic Miss Limitations

Features that trigger an effect on a missed attack, such as the *Potent Cantrip* feature, do not function when an attack results in an automatic miss.

### Area-of-Effect Spell Mitigation

No feature provides absolute immunity to area-of-effect spells for allies. The Evoker’s **Sculpt Spells** and the Sorcerer’s **Careful Spell** instead grant affected allies Advantage on the saving throw and the **Evasion** feature for that instance.

:::note Evasion
When subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the target takes no damage on a success and only half damage on a failure. This version of Evasion functions even while incapacitated, and the target makes the saving throw normally.

## Spells

### Blade Ward

The penalty to the attack roll is changed from `-1d4` to a flat `-1`.

### Ceremony

The number of vials created per casting equals your spellcasting modifier. The material component cost is 25 gp of powdered silver per vial.

### Ray of enfeeblement

This spell no longer requires concentration.

### True Strike
The damage dealt by this spell is of the same type as the weapon used. If the weapon is magical, the damage is also considered magical.

## Resurrection

### Revivify

Casting *Revivify* requires the caster to sacrifice a portion of their life force. The caster suffers a permanent -1 penalty to a randomly determined ability score.

### Three strikes and you are out

Upon a character's third resurrection attempt, the restoration is no longer automatic. The target must immediately make Death Saving Throws to determine if the soul successfully returns. On a failure, the spell is consumed without effect and the character remains dead.

The difficulty of the resurrection depends on the spell used:

| Spell | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Revivify*, *Raise Dead*, or *Reincarnate* | Standard Death Saving Throws |
| *Resurrection* | The target makes the saves with Advantage |
| *True Resurrection* or *Wish* | Automatic success; no rolls required |

### Instant Death

Characters killed by the Instant Death rule cannot be restored to life using the *Revivify* spell. Higher-level resurrection magic is required to return them to life.

### Resurrection weakness

If a character dies while still suffering the penalties of a resurrection spell, their Constitution score is permanently reduced by 1.

## Spellcasting Services  

The pricing for spellcasting services is calculated using the following formula, replacing the costs listed in the *Player’s Handbook* (p. 232):

:::note Price formula
$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Price} = (\text{Spell Level}^2 * 25) \\
& \phantom{\text{Price}} + (\text{Consumed Material Component Cost}) \\
& \phantom{\text{Price}} + (0.10 * \text{Non-consumed Material Component Cost})
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

| Spell Level | Base Price without components|
|:-----------:|------:|
| 1           | 25    |
| 2           | 100   |
| 3           | 225   |
| 4           | 400   |
| 5           | 625   |
| 6           | 900   |
| 7           | 1225  |
| 8           | 1600  |
| 9           | 2025  |

:::info Rituals

Spells cast as rituals cost 50% of the base service price. Material component costs remain unchanged.
