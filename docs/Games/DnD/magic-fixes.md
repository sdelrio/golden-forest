## Spellcasting Services  
The pricing for spellcasting services listed in page 232 PHB is outrageous.  
Instead, the pricing for this services is calculated using the following formula:  
(Spell level X Spell level X 25)+(Consumed Material Component Cost)+(0,10 X Non-Consumed Material Component Cost). Price in Gold Pieces.  
Spells cast as rituals cost half the price of the service (component cost remain the same as above)
