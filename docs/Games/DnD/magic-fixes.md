## Spells
**Ray of enfeeblement**  
This spell doesn't require concentration  
## Resurrection Effects
**Revivify**  
Every time a character cast Revivify, its life force is diminished. The caster permanently loses 1 point from a random ability score.  

**Three strikes and you are out**  
If the character is being brought from the dead for a 3rd time, instead of being raised, the character receiving the resurrection must roll Death Saving Throws.  
If successful, he's resurrected. If not, the spell is wasted.  
The more powerful resurrection spells can bring the character to life more easily:  
*Revivify and Raise Dead*: No bonus  
*Resurrection and Reincarnation*: Advantage on the character's Death Saving Throws.  
*True Resurrection and Wish*: Automatic Success.  
  
**Resurrection weakness**  
If a Character dies again while still weak from the negative effects of a resurrection spell, it loses 1 point of Constitution permanently.  

## Spellcasting Services  
The pricing for spellcasting services listed in page 232 PHB is outrageous.  
Instead, the pricing for these services is calculated using the following formula:  
(Spell level X Spell level X 25)+(Consumed Material Component Cost)+(0,10 X Non-Consumed Material Component Cost). Price in Gold Pieces.  
Spells cast as rituals cost half the price of the service (component cost remain the same as above)
