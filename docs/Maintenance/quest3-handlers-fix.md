# Quest 3 Controller Drift Fix

Controller drift, where the thumbstick moves the virtual view or character without input, is a common issue caused by dust, debris, or wear inside the mechanism. This guide provides the most popular DIY fix using an electronics contact cleaner.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: Use the Right Product!

**DO NOT** use standard, blue-can WD-40 lubricant. This can damage the internal electronics and plastic components.

You **MUST** use an electronics-safe, residue-free product, such as:

* **WD-40 Specialist Contact Cleaner** (the black can).
* **DeoxIT D5** (or similar dedicated electronics cleaner).

Using the wrong chemical will void your warranty and likely destroy your controller.

## Step 1: Preparation and Disassembly

Before applying any cleaner, you must power down the controller to prevent short circuits.

1. **Remove the Batteries:** Turn the controller over and slide open the battery compartment cover. **Remove the battery immediately** .
2. **Locate the Thumbstick Base:** Identify the circular base where the thumbstick meets the controller housing. This is where the dust and debris accumulate.

## Step 2: Applying the Contact Cleaner

This step flushes out the contaminants that are causing the phantom movement (drift).

1. **Insert the Straw:** Attach the thin applicator straw to the contact cleaner nozzle.
2. **Lift the Thumbstick Boot:** Gently tilt the thumbstick to the side (e.g., press it fully left). This creates a small gap beneath the plastic "boot" that covers the mechanism.
3. **Spray Carefully (1 Second Burst):** Insert the straw tip into the tiny gap you created. Press the nozzle for **a quick, 1-second burst**. A small amount is all you need.
4. **Repeat on All Sides:** Rotate the thumbstick to expose the gap on the opposite side (e.g., right, up, down) and apply a brief spray to each side.

## Step 3: Working the Cleaner In

This is crucial for ensuring the cleaner reaches all contact points and clears debris.

1. **Rotate and Cycle:** Immediately after spraying, vigorously rotate the thumbstick in full circles for about 30 seconds.
2. **Click the Stick:** Press the thumbstick button (L3/R3) repeatedly (about 20-30 times) while rotating it. This helps distribute the cleaner into the mechanism's switches.
3. **Allow to Dry (15-30 Minutes):** **Do not reinsert the battery immediately.** The cleaner must fully evaporate. Leave the controller for at least 15 to 30 minutes in a well-ventilated area.

## Step 4: Testing and Recalibration

Once the controller is completely dry, you can test the fix and recalibrate if residual drift persists.

1. **Test the Fix:**
   * Reinsert the battery and turn on the Quest 3 headset.
   * Navigate to the **Settings** menu to monitor the controller's input in a neutral environment.
   * If the drift is gone, you are finished!
2. **Recalibration (If Drift Persists):**
   * In the Quest 3 headset, navigate to: **Settings** ➡️ **Controllers** ➡️ **Tracking**.
   * Select **Controller Thumbstick Deadzone and Range**.
   * You will see a visualization of the stick input. If it is slightly off-center (indicating drift), slowly increase the **Deadzone** until the input dot is perfectly centered and stable.
   * **Deadzone** is the small area around the center where input is ignored. Setting a small deadzone can successfully hide minimal drift without impacting gameplay.

If both cleaning and recalibration fail, the thumbstick mechanism is likely permanently worn out and the controller may need to be replaced.
