# Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation platform that makes your applications and systems easier to deploy and maintain. Automate everything from code deployment to network configuration to cloud management, in a language that approaches plain English, using SSH, with no agents to install on remote systems.

## AWX

AWX provides a web-based user interface, REST API, and task engine built on top of [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible). Is the Open Source version of Ansible Tower.

## ARA Records Ansible

ARA provides reporting by saving detailed and granular results of ansible and ansible-playbook commands wherever you run them:

* By hand or from a script
* From a laptop, a desktop, a container or a server
* For development, CI or production
* From a linux distribution or even on OS X (as long as you have `python >= 3.5`)
* From tools such as AWX or Tower, Jenkins, GitLab CI, Rundeck, Zuul, Molecule, ansible-pull, ansible-test or ansible-runner

By default, araâ€™s Ansible callback plugin will record data to a local sqlite database without requiring you to run a server or a service
