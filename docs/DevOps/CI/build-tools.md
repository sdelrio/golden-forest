# Build Tools

## [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/)

Can run on top of popular CI systems (like Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions). It is typically the layer between language-specific tooling (like maven, gradle, npm, pip, go build) and the CI build spec.

Earthly is a syntax for defining your build. It works with your existing build system. Get repeatable and understandable builds today.
