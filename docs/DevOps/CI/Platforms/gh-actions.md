# GitHub Actions

## UI for making pipelines

In `.github/workflows` create a yaml file and edit through Github's UI.

## VMs used in GH Actions

* [linux](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/tree/main/images/linux)
  * [ubuntu 18](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/master/images/linux/Ubuntu1804-README.md)
  * [ubuntu 20](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2004-README.md)


## Caching docker builds

* Use `docker save` and `docker load` with `actions/cache`
If the cache size is big (near 1GB or more). It turns out that `docker save` is very slow. So, uploading that tarball into the cache also takes a long time.
If the cache size is big (near 1GB or more). It turns out that `docker push` is faster than `docker save`. The same for `docker pull` vs `docker load`.
