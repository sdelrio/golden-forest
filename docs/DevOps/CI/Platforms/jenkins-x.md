# Jenkis-X

Automate the continuous delivery of change through your environments via GitOps and create previews on Pull Requests.

Jenkins-X is a set of tools, not a full program like the old Jenkins. In the first version they used this set of apps:

- skaffold
- draft
- nexus
- knative
- chart museum
- jenkins

Then later started do migrate to other tools, like replacing Jenkins for Tekton.
