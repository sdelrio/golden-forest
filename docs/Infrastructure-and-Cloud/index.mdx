# Infrastructure & Cloud ⚙️

Welcome to the core of automation and scaling! This pillar holds all my notes on how to design, deploy, and manage modern systems, from the base network to large-scale orchestration.

This is where efficiency meets complexity. The tools and platforms detailed here are highly interdependent, covering the entire lifecycle of an application: the platform where it runs, how it is built and delivered, and the network that connects it.

## 🧭 Main Sub-Pillars

Explore the following areas to dive into the design of distributed systems and software delivery:

Cloud Infrastructure & Platform: Notes on platforms like AWS, GCP, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.

Containers: Details on runtimes and tools like Docker and CRI.

DevOps: Methodologies, CI/CD flows, IaC (Infrastructure as Code), and how to configure effective development environments.

Networking: Everything about the connectivity layer: CDN, VPN, LAN, and high-performance networks (10Gb).

## ⚡ Suggested Impact Paths

If you are looking to solve a specific problem or start studying a topic, here are some recommended paths:
