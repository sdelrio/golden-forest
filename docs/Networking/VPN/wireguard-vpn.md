# WireGuard VPN

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography.
It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache.
It intends to be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. 

WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers
alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now 
cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely deployable.

It's included in Linus Kernel since v5.6.
