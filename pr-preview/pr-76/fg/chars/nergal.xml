					<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to your crimson rite damage die to gain advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or Charisma (Intimidation) check.</p>

					<p>At 1st level. you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites listed below. You cannot change this choice.</p>
					<p>As a bonus action. you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite for up to 8 hours. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is completed.</p>
					<p>When a crimson rite is activated, it reduces your maximum hit points by a number equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored by other means. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoration of maximum hit points.</p>
					<p>Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons. costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a seperate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time with no action required.</p>
					<p>You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You may learn one Esoteric Rite from the list below at 14th level.</p>
					<p><b>Primal Rites</b></p>
					<p>Choose from the following:</p>
					<list>

					<p>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &quot;trance.&quot;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
