					<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track Fey, fiends, and Undead, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. If you are actively tracking one of these creature types, you cannot be surprised by any creatures of that type. You can only be tracking one type of creature at a time.</p>
					<p>Upon reaching 11th level, you can flare the internal toxic scars from the ritual, using the pain to give clarity, or promote anger. You can choose to suffer damage equal to your crimson rite damage die to gain advantage on a Wisdom (Insight) check or Charisma (Intimidation) check.</p>

					<p>At lst level. you learn to invoke a rite of blood magic within your weapon at the cost of your own vitality. Choose to learn one rite from the Primal Rites listed below. You cannot change this choice.</p>
					<p>As a bonus action. you imbue a single weapon with the elemental energy of a known rite for up to 8 hours. While active, attacks from this weapon deal an additional 1d4 rite damage of the chosen elemental type. Rite damage is considered magical. The rite damage die changes as you gain blood hunter levels, as shown in the crimson rite damage die column of the blood hunter table. Should your weapon leave your grip, the rite fades immediately. An active rite on a weapon thrown fades directly after the attack is completed.</p>
					<p>When a crimson rite is activated, it reduces your maximum hit points by a number equal to your character level. These lost maximum hit points return once the rite fades and cannot be restored by other means. When a rite fades, no hit points are regained as part of the restoration of maximum hit points.</p>
					<p>Crimson rite can be used on multiple weapons. costing additional hit point loss. Most weapons can only be subject to a single rite at any given time. Each end of a polearm or quarterstaff is treated as a seperate weapon for the purposes of this feature. A rite can be allowed to fade at any time with no action required.</p>
					<p>You gain access to an additional Primal Rite at 6th level and 11th level. You can choose to learn one Esoteric Rite from the list below at 14th level.</p>
					<p><b>Primal Rites</b></p>
					<p>Choose from the following:</p>
					<list>
						<li><b>Rite of the Flame: </b>Your rite damage is fire type.</li>
						<li><b>Rite of the Frozen: </b>Your rite damage is cold type.</li>
						<li><b>Rite of the Storm: </b>Your rite damage is lightning type.</li>

					<p>The magics adopted by the wayward blood hunter prove formidable against many an evil across the realm. However, the darkest of abominations draw from an ancient well of cruel, unfathomable power. These terrors can control shadows to do their bidding, hide in plain sight among the noblest of nobles, and bend the minds of the most stalwart warrior with but a glance. These fiends were far trickier to hunt, and many lost their lives in pursuit of such wickedness.</p>
					<p>A small sect of blood hunters had finaly had enough and delved into this same well of corrupting arcane knowledge, making pacts with lesser evils to better combat the greater. While they may have lost a part of themselves, the power gained far outwelghted the price, for even devils now quake when they know they've the attention of the Order of the Profane Soul.</p>

					<p>At 3rd level, your weapon becomes a core to your pact with your chosen dark patron. You can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus (found in chapter 5, phb) for your warlock spells. Your chosen pact also enhances your rite (outlined below).</p>
					<p><b>The Archfey. </b>If you deal rite damage to a creature, that creature loses any half or three-quarters cover bonuses, as well as invisibility, until the beginning of your next turn.</p>
					<p><b>The Fiend. </b>While using the Kite of the Flame, if you roll a 1 on your rite damage die, you may reroll the die. You may do this reroll only once per attack.</p>
					<p><b>The Great Old One. </b>Whenever you deal a critical hit to a creature, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, On a failure, the creature is frightened of you until the end of your next turn.</p>
					<p><b>The Undying. </b>Whenever you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, and kill it, you regain hit points equal to your crimson rite damage die.</p>

					<p>When you reach 3rd level, you strike a bargan with an other worldy being of your choice; the Archfey, the Fiend, or the Great Old One, each detailed on page 109 of the PHB, or the Undying on page 139 of the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, Your choice augments some of your order features.</p>
					<p><b>Pact Magic</b></p>
					<p>When you reach 3rd level, you can augment your combat techniques with the ability to cast Warlock spells. See chapter 10 (phb) for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 (phb) for the Warlock spell list.</p>
					<p><b>Cantrips</b></p>
					<p>You learn two can trips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
					<p><b>Spell Slots</b></p>
					<p>The Profane Soul Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
					<p>For example, when you are 8th level, you have two 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell.</p>
					<p><b>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</b></p>
					<p>At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.</p>
					<p>The Spells Known column of the Profane Soul table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 11th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.</p>
					<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class and Order, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace is with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
					<p><b>Spellcasting Ability</b></p>
					<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your 'Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
					<p><b>Spell save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
					<p><b>Spell attack modifier </b>= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>

					<p>A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class's spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.</p>
					<p>If the spell is on your class's spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10+ the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.</p>
					<p>Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.</p>

					<p>If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends.</p>
					<p>If you create an image of an object-such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest-it must be no larger than a5-foot cube. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.</p>
					<p>If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.</p>
