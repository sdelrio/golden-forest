							<td colspan="3">When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.</td>

							<td><b>Disarming Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</td>

							<td><b>Distracting Strike</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening.

							<td colspan="3">You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The advantage is lost if not used on the turn you gain it.</td>

							<td><b>Goading Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.</td>

							<td><b>Lunging Attack</b></td>

							<td><b>Maneuvering Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target of your attack.</td>

							<td><b>Menacing Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to frighten the target.

							<td><b>Pushing Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to drive the target back.

							<td><b>Rally</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions.

							<td><b>Sweeping Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><b>Trip Attack</b></td>
							<td colspan="3">When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</td>

					<p><b>Superiority Dice. </b>You have four superiority dice, which are d8s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
					<p>You gain another superiority die at 7th level and one more at 15th level.</p>
					<p><b>Saving Throws. </b>Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
					<p><b>Maneuver save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)</p>
