				<text type="formattedtext">
					<p>As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Cantrips</b>
					</p>
					<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spellbook</b>
					</p>
					<p>At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Preparing and Casting Spells</b>
					</p>
					<p>The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
					<p>You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
					<p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
					<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spellcasting Ability</b>
					</p>
					<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.</p>
					<p>In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spell save DC </b>= 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spell attack modifier </b>= your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
					<p>
						<b>Ritual Casting</b>
					</p>
					<p>You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don't need to have the spell prepared.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Spellcasting Focus</b>
					</p>
					<p>You can use an arcane focus (found in chapter 5) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.</p>
					<p>
						<b>Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher</b>
					</p>
					<p>Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your</p>
					<p>adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the &#34;Your Spellbook&#34; sidebar).</p>
					<h>Your Spellbook</h>
					<p>The spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Copying a Spell into the book. </i>
						</b>When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. The spells copied into a spellbook must be of a spell level the wizard can prepare.</p>
					<p>Copying a spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>
					<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>Replacing the Book. </i>
						</b>You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book-for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell. If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>
					<p>
						<b>
							<i>The Book's Appearance </i>
						</b>Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>
					<p>A spellbook doesn't contain cantrips.</p>

					<p>Bladesingers are elves who bravely defend their people and lands. They are elf wizards who master a school of sword fighting grounded in a tradition of arcane magic. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense.</p>

						<b>Restriction: </b>Elves Only</p>
					<p>Only elves and half-elves can choose the bladesinger arcane tradition. In the world of Faerun, elves closely guard the secrets of bladesinging.</p>
					<p>Your DM can lift this restriction to better suit the campaign. The restriction reflects the story of bladesingers in the Forgotten Realms, but it might not apply to your DM's setting or your DM's version of the Realms.</p>

						<i>2nd-level Bladesinging feature</i>
					</p>
					<p>You can invoke an elven magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.</p>
					<p>You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).</p>
					<p>While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:</p>
					<list>
						<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
						<li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
						<li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li>
						<li>You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
					</list>
					<p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.</p>

					<p>Red Wizards who leave the comfort of their towers on Thaymount try to prepare themselves in multiple ways. This ring is just one of them. It appears as a band of plain steel. A <i>ring of resourceful wizardry </i>allows you to improve your mastery of the arcane - and on occasion access magic that would otherwise be denied.</p>
					<p>While you wear this ring, you gain proficiency on Intelligence (Arcana) checks you make. If you are already proficient, you gain expertise.</p>
					<p>In addition, as a bonus action you can switch a spell you have prepared with another spell of the same level or lower you have in your spellbook. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>

					<p>Nuestra expedici&#243;n ha llegado a las cercan&#237;as de mano de Seldar&#237;n. La regi&#243;n es peligrosa y hemos perdido un hombre en el ataque de un Remorhaz. Afortunadamente esta zona es inusualmente c&#225;lida para la latitud que corresponde y no hemos de temer m&#225;s ataques similares.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Nos hemos establecido en la margen Este del r&#237;o Dorn, cerca del puente de Sehanine. El puente est&#225; muy deteriorado, pero es firme y permite el paso de personas. Esta margen marca el per&#237;metro mas exterior de los campos Gladios, ahora tristemente llamados Campos de la Masacre, por la cantidad de muertos, elfos y orcos que perecieron aqu&#237;. Establecemos nuestro campamento en una loma cerca del r&#237;o, para tener el suministro de agua y comida asegurados.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Empezamos a realizar unas primeras excavaciones cerca de la zona del puente y de nuestro campamento. Nos ayudamos de la magia para tratar de detectar cualquier objeto que merezca la pena desenterrar. La lucha aqu&#237; no fue muy feroz ya que los orcos atacaron repentinamente y con mucha fuerza, impidiendo que nuestro pueblo pudiera organizar una defensa eficaz en este lugar y teniendo que ceder gran parte de los Campos Gladios al enemigo.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Hemos observado esqueletos y otros no-muertos menores merodeando la zona en grupos dispersos. No parecen muy peligrosos, pero nos mantenemos alerta.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Orophin, y una escolta de dos hombres, marchan a explorar las cercan&#237;as de Mano de Seldar&#237;n para ver si es viable mover el campamento m&#225;s all&#225; de los campos gladios, cerca del Lago Nival.</p>
					<p>Orophin quiere observar de cerca la anomal&#237;a m&#225;gica de Mano de Seldar&#237;n.</p>
					<p />
					<p>Melira Taralen me debe sonre&#237;r. Excavando cerca del campamento no hab&#237;amos conseguido nada m&#225;s que restos deteriorados de chatarra orca. Sin embargo esta ma&#241;ana comenz&#243; con el hallazgo de una armadura &#233;lfica en mal estado, pero consistente con las armaduras de la guardia personal de la Casa Kanan. Desenterrando restos de la zona circundante hemos encontrado los restos mortales de varios guardias m&#225;s y de una persona m&#225;s que portaba un morral de cuero de gran calidad con un diario en su interior.</p>
					<p>Y gracias a Melira, &#161;es nada menos que el diario de Evayne Kanan!. Cuando lo vea Orophin se va a poner l&#237;vido de envidia.</p>

It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.\n\nYou can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use two hands to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time you choose (no action required).\n\nWhile your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:\n\n* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\n* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.\n* You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nYou can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.</shortdescription>

					<p>You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.</p>
					<p>An affected target's speed is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions. On its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both. Regardless of the creature's abilities or magic items, it can't make more than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.</p>
					<p>If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.</p>
					<p>A creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for it.</p>

					<p>This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range.

For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.</p>

					<p>This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw. This spell can't affect a target that has 0 hit points.</p>
					<p>The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.</p>
					<p>The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.</p>
					<p>The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>

					<p>Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is &#34;trance.&#34;) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
